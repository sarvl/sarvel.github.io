		<h1> 16b2x CPU </h1>
		date: 2022-05 ; 2023-01 ; 2023-04  <br>
		desc: second CPU design, mostly fixes from previous designs ; implemented unified memory ; first CPU written in VHDL <br>
		proj: not available, maybe will be, not sure <br> 

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>


		<h2> OVERVIEW </h2>

		<br>
		
		as with previous design, this CPU was initially done in logisim <br>
		this time there were no major flaws in the ISA, general layout was somewhat inspired by <a href="../Knowledge/resources.html">SAP from Digital Computer Electronics</a> (same thing that Ben Eater used for <a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU>8 bit computer</a>)<br>
		pretty much everything that had to be fixed from previous design, was fixed <br>
		as note near ROM/RAM (and as some features of ISA which is described below) suggests, project was not fully complete then (or ever) <br>

		<br>
		<br>

		added circuitry allowed for instructions to execute for 2 cycles which is essential for unified data and instruction memory <br>
		most instructions execute in 1 cycle as in previous iteration, loads and stores take 2 cycles <br>
		during 1st they access data, during 2nd they access next instruction <br>

		<br>
		<br>
		first major-ish project in VHDL so code is not as good as it should be, entire project is in single file, including tests <br>
		implementation does not have multicycle instructions for simplicity, same as first iteration of entire project <br>

		<h3> Instruction Format: </h3>
		<pre>
	AAAABBBC XXXXXXXX

	AAAA - opcode
	BBB  - Rd id
	C    - if 1 then second operand is immediate, otherwise it is register
	X3   - Rs
	X4   - imm4
	X8   - imm8

	Xn means last n bits of X
		</pre>

		<h3> Example Program: </h3>
		<pre class=code>

	mov 	R0, 0
	mov 	R1, 1
	
	#computes nth fib number
	mov 	R7, 9

	jz  	R7, end
loop:
	stw 	R0, 0
	
	mov 	R2, R0
	mov 	R0, R1
	add 	R1, R2

	sub 	R7, 1
	jnz 	R7, loop

end:
	mov 	R0, R0 #nop for assembler to place label correctly

		</pre>

		<h2> UNIFIED MEMORY </h2>
		the main goal of this project was to unify memory <br>
		unfortunately I dont remember attemps too well but the entire approach was very convoluted and ultimately could not work <br>
		idea (as much as I remember) was to check whether data is already out and if so switch address <br>
		this cannot work because there is nothing that stores 1st result so a register has to be added <br>
		but a register cannot just store data whenever and has to wait for clock so the only solution is to have multicycle operation <br>
		note 1: there is another slight problem with checking availability of data - logisim RAM outputs data almost immediattely and does not signal whether it is ready <br>
		note 2: even with latch (which does not update on edge) something like clock has to be used to decide when to update that latch <br>
		note 3: updating on half cycle works too but that behaves identically (from digital logic POV) as twice as fast clock <br>
		<br>
		after taking long break and accepting multicycle operation, unified memory worked pretty much instantly <br>
		CPU was not designed with more than 1 cpi and it was kind of hacked in <br>
		each instruction has "last cycle" in control signals and if it is set then instruction is fetched to <b>I</b>nstruction <b>R</b>egister, this is usually the case <br>
		if it is NOT set then IR is not updated and '1' is written to additional 1b register which allows current instruction cycle to be updated to 1 <br>
		the middle-man register is completely not needed, next design fixed this problem <br>
		solution is to NOT use ASYNC reset of register that holds current cycle of instruction, as was done, for some reason <br>

		<h2> VHDL </h2>
		VHDL here was mostly like processor design of the 16b1x, giant pile of mess, not knowing what I am doing and trying to make things work <br>
		921 lines of entities with their testbenches and CPU <br> 
		most of which is VHDL boilerplate (that part did not change in later projects) and actual logic is simple, CPU body (connections between components and logic) has only 60 LOC<br>
		most of which are whitespace or VHDL keywords <br>
		other than that, it is almost 1:1 translation of first iteration <br> 

		<h2> THE GOOD </h2>
		No disasters and fixed previous mistakes! <br>
		instructions were allocated properly and format is pleasant to write assembler for (this time it was written almost immediattely, as it should) <br>
		overall layout is also much nicer to look at however individual components are mostly identical as in 16b1x <br>

		<h2> THE BAD </h2>
		no stupidly bad decisions and mistakes like last time, all are minor enough to land in THE UGLY <br>

		<h2> THE UGLY </h2>
		Did not use ports even though there are somewhat specified in the ISA <br>
		ISA coulds still be copy-pasted here and site would still be readable <br>
		this is because CPU is so simple there is nothing to document, later ones radically improve on complexity (and being interesting) side <br>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_slide">NOP slide</a> is still present and there is no <span class=code>halt</span> instruction so CPU always executes <br>

		<ul>
			<li> <h2> LECTURES </h2> </li> 
			<ul> 
				<li> 
					<h3> Berkeley CS 61C </h3> <br> 
					video:  https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_itunesu_960798612 <br>
					course: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/ <br>
					INTRODUCTORY <br>
					<br>	
					explain computer architectures concepts from basics using MIPS architecture and C <br>
					building processor with cache and some typical topics <br>
					quite information dense <br>
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3> DDCA </h3> <br> 
					video:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi-EImKxYYY1SZuGiOAOBKaf <br>
					course: https://safari.ethz.ch/digitaltechnik/spring2023/doku.php?id=start <br>
					INTRODUCTORY <br>
					<br>	
					explain computer architecture concepts with MIPS and C <br>
					quite fast paced course with a lot of links to papers <br>
					not really information dense but very breadth in scope <br>	
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3> ACA </h3> <br> 
					video:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi-Mnk1PxjEIG32HAGILkTOF <br> 
					course: https://safari.ethz.ch/architecture/fall2021/doku.php <br>
					ADVANCED <br>
					<br>	
					quite information dense and many interesting papers <br>
					but Mutlu spends a lot of time on philosophy of why and how to do something <br>	
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3> Berkeley CS 152/252A </h3> <br> 
					video:  (available from course website clicking at each lecture, unfortunately not all are available) <br> 
					course: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs152/sp23/ <br>
					ADVANCED <br>
					<br>	
					useful discussion sessions <br>
					quite information dense with interesting papers on website <br>	
					newer version (2024) is available though I did not watch it <br>
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3> Udemy HPCA </h3> <br> 
					video:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAwxTw4SYaPmqpjgrmf4-DGlaeV0om4iP <br> 
					(link above is only to part1, there are 6 parts available on youtube) </br>
					ADVANCED <br>
					<br>	
					very information dense and in depth about many concepts <br>
					after theory there are questions to answer which verify understanding </br>
					only downside is inconvienient short format <br>	
				</li>
			<ul>
			<li> <h2> BOOKS </h2> </li>
			<ul> 
				<li> 
					<h3> Computer Organization and Design </h3> <br> 
					INTRODUCTORY <br>
					<br>	
					used by many university coures <br>
					covers basics of computer architecture using arm/mips/riscv (depends on edition) <br>
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3> Computer Systems a Proprammer's Perspective</h3> <br> 
					INTRODUCTORY <br>
					<br>	
					first six chapters are about computer architecture related topics, rest are software <br>
					very good book, problems appear between text to immediattely provoke thinking (global edition contains errors) <br>
					however as the name suggests it is mainly focused on <u>programmer's</u> perspective so details are ommited<br> 
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3> Computer architecture a quantitative approach </h3> <br> 
					ADVANCED <br>
					<br>	
					still reading, seems good <br>	
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3> Modern Processor design </h3> <br> 
					ADVANCED <br>
					<br>	
					still reading, a bit dated, seems good <br>	
				</li>
			</ul>

		yes this colorscheme is perfect, i am not changing it <br> 
		it takes 5 seconds to change it yourself <br>
